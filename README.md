# Healthcare Risk Assessment

This project fetches patient data from an API, processes it to identify:
- **High-risk patients** (risk_score ≥ 4)
- **Fever patients** (temperature ≥ 99.6°F)
- **Data quality issues** (missing/invalid data)

It then **submits the results back to the assessment API** for scoring.
